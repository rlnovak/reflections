When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Mainly when I am collaborating with people in other places. I could also use it as a backup of my main software projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we can control the branch and the commits we pull.
